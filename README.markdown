# RobotGymnast's Skill Queuer

[ping's skill-queuing script](http://bit.ly/gqueue) for Glitch, modified by RobotGymnast.

Features:
 - Add/remove skills to the queue.
 - Select from a list of all unlearned skills.
 - If an unlearnable skill is encountered, it's skipped.
 - Periodic checks to see if the completion time has changed (for instance, because of spending favor).
